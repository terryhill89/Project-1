• Aster - A couple of additions I added that may have been pushed to the main branch. I wrote the fire_acre_burn.ipynb, fire_acre_burn_soCal.ipynb, and fire_data_graphs.ipynb files which grabbed and plotted data off fire.ca.gov, turned the ISO 8601 Timestamps it provided into UNIX Timestams in order to create a Months column via binning and saved them to CSV. these can be seen in the cleaned_csv file under Resources I also wrote the CSV_cleaner.ipynb file as a group resource to aid us all in cleaning up some of our CSVs (:

PROJECT 1 INFO: How is California’s drought altering wildfire frequency and intensity throughout California?

Climate change, primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires not only in California but also all over the world. Since 1950, the area burned by California wildfires each year has been increasing, as spring and summer temperatures have warmed and spring snowmelt has occurred earlier.

California Air Resources Board This project will be looking at the effects of drought on California’s wildfire frequency and intensity levels throughout the years 2000 - present. The data used to conduct this analysis will come from California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Services (CalFire) and the United States Drought Monitor. This analysis will be diving into the yearly average acres burned from wildfires and the yearly average drought levels across California. We will be determining which areas of California are the most affected by the drought and increasing wildfires.

Analysis Overall we are seeing more wildfire occurrences while drought conditions are in severe (D2) to exceptional (D4), especially in Southern CA. California has been averaging a higher drought level since 2015, than in the previous 10 years. We are seeing more wildfires and larger burn areas since 2015.

Summary While there can be many factors affecting wildfires, with the data we observed, we believe there is a correlation between higher levels of drought and the frequency/intensity of wildfires in California. We observed that there were more wildfires, and more intense wildfires, in years that California was in a severe to exceptional drought level; therefore, we believe that drought does have an effect on the intensity/frequency of wildfires.
